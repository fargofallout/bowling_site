<p>This is the main page, where I sort of have to figure out the flow of this thing.</p>

<a href="{% url 'bowling:bowler' %}">All Bowlers (eventually)</a><br>
- this goes to a page that lists all bowlers, and lets you add new bowlers<br><br>
<a href="{% url 'bowling:team' %}">All Teams</a><br>
- this goes to the teams page, where you can add new teams (and maybe bowlers, too?)<br><br>
<a href="{% url 'bowling:league' %}">Leagues</a><br>
- all leagues - I don't think this will be used very much<br><br>
<a href="{% url 'bowling:week' %}">New week</a><br>
- this will go to the new week workflow<br><br>

questions:<br>
- place to add a new league?<br>
- place to modify/add games? or will that be handled on the bowler page?<br>
